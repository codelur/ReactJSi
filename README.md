**About the Project**

This template provides a minimal but robust setup for building React applications using Vite, a next-generation build tool known for its blazing-fast development experience. It offers Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for seamless live updates during development, along with preconfigured ESLinting for code quality and consistency.

**Technologies Used**

React: Declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces
Vite: Ultra-fast bundler leveraging native ESM support and pre-bundling
ESLint: Extensible linter for identifying and enforcing coding standards.

**Development Server**

Start the development server using:

Bash
npm run dev

This will launch Vite and open your application in the default browser, typically at http://localhost:3000/. Changes to your React components will be reflected instantly without full page reloads, thanks to HMR.

**File Structure**

The project follows a basic structure:

src/

# Your main application component

components/

# Reusable React components

App.jsx
Header.jsx
Main.jsx

# Components styles

App.css
Header.css
Main.css

---

index.css
main.jsx # Entry point for your application
package.json # Project dependencies and scripts

**ESLint**

ESLint is configured to enforce coding styles and identify potential issues. You can run ESLint manually using:

Bash
npm run lint

This will scan your JavaScript files and report any linting errors or warnings.

**Fast Refresh**

Vite provides two official plugins for Fast Refresh:

@vitejs/plugin-react: Leverages Babel for Fast Refresh.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Uses SWC for Fast Refresh (a Rust-based alternative to Babel).
Both options allow for component updates without full page reloads. The current installation uses @vitejs/plugin-react.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions to this project! Please feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, improvements, or new features. Make sure to follow the established coding style and include clear explanations for your changes. We'll review your contributions promptly.
